# ElGamal
ElGamal encryption is a public-key cryptosystem. It uses asymmetric key encryption for communicating between two parties and encrypting the message. This cryptosystem is based on the difficulty of finding discrete logarithm in a cyclic group that is even if we know ga and gk, it is extremely difficult to compute gak.
# Task
Write your own software implementation of digital signature and encryption of messages using the El-Gamal algorithm.
## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Compile the Java code: `javac ElGamalSignature.java` to use signature methods and run it: `java ElGamalSignature` <br>
Compile the Java code: `javac ElGamalEncryption.java` to see the encription and decription methods and run it: `java ElGamalEncryption`
